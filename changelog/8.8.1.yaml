      summary: Fix deadlock condition in RuntimeManager
      description: |
        In some cases it was possible that a running component would lose connection to the Elastic Agent and
        unable to re-connect because of a concurrent updated component model. With it being unable to re-connect
        and the Elastic Agent unable to send it latest component model it results in the Elastic Agent hitting
        a deadlock where it cannot run properly.
