      summary: '[otel] Disable process scraper of hostmetrics receiver'
      description: |
        The process scraper collects metrics for all available processes of a host without an easy way to limit
        this to only report top N process for example. This results in quite big amount of timeseries.
        Since this is not quite critical for any of the available UIs or dashboards we decide to disable
        it temporarily until we find a better solution. Users that specifically need these metrics
        can also enable it back manually.

      summary: relax file ownership check to allow admin re-enrollment on Windows
      description: |
        On Windows, the agent previously enforced a strict file ownership (SID) check during re-enrollment, which prevented legitimate admin users from re-enrolling the agent if the owner did not match. This PR changes the Windows-specific logic to a no-op, allowing any admin to re-enroll the agent. This restores usability for admin users, but reintroduces the risk that privileged re-enrollment can break unprivileged installs. The Unix-specific ownership check remains unchanged.
