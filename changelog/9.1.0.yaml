      summary: relax file ownership check to allow admin re-enrollment on Windows
      description: |
        On Windows, the agent previously enforced a strict file ownership (SID) check during re-enrollment, which prevented legitimate admin users from re-enrolling the agent if the owner did not match. This PR changes the Windows-specific logic to a no-op, allowing any admin to re-enroll the agent. This restores usability for admin users, but reintroduces the risk that privileged re-enrollment can break unprivileged installs. The Unix-specific ownership check remains unchanged.
