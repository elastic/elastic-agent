.[Otel] Disable Process Scraper Of Hostmetrics Receiver. {elastic-agent-pull}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/7894[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/7894] 
[%collapsible]
====
The process scraper collects metrics for all available processes of a host without an easy way to limit
this to only report top N process for example. This results in quite big amount of timeseries.
Since this is not quite critical for any of the available UIs or dashboards we decide to disable
it temporarily until we find a better solution. Users that specifically need these metrics
can also enable it back manually.
Related to https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/39423.

[[new-features-9.1.0]]
=== New features

The 9.1.0 release adds the following new and notable features.




* Added Support For Pre-Existing Active Directory User For Unprivileged Mode.  {-issue}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/4585[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/4585]
+
User can specify custom pre-existing user for running unprivileged mode. This user will be given permissions to log on as a service.
* Add Filesource Provider. {-pull}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6587[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6587] {-issue}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/6362[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/6362]
+
filesource provider watches for changes of the files and updates the values of the variables
when the content of the file changes.

* Add --Id And --Replace-Token To Enrollment. {-pull}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6498[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6498] {-issue}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/6361[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/issues/6361]
+
Add support for --id and --replace-token to the install and enroll command. Add support for ELASTIC_AGENT_ID
and FLEET_REPLACE_TOKEN to the container support the same behavior as the enroll command. Allows the ability to
define a specific ID to use for the Elastic Agent when enrolling into Fleet. The replace-token defines the token
that must be used to re-enroll an Elastic Agent with the same ID as a replacement of the previous Elastic Agent.

to reference env provider when no provider prefix is provided in the variable.

* Add Nginx Receiver And Redis Receiver Otel Components.  
* Add Motel Sample Configurations. {elastic-agent-pull}https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6630[#https://github.com/elastic/elastic-agent/pull/6630]

+
The value of the `agent.upgrade.rollback.window` setting determines the period after upgrading
Elastic Agent when a rollback to the previous version can be triggered. This is an optional
setting, with a default value of `168h` (7 days). The value can be any string that is parseable
by https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration.

+
This PR removes the `resource/k8s` processor in honour of the k8sattributes processor that
provides native support for the Service attributes:
https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/v0.127.0/processor/k8sattributesprocessor#configuring-recommended-resource-attributes

This change is aligned with the respective Semantic Conventions&#39; guidance:
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/k8s-attributes/#service-attributes

* Add File Logs Only Motel Kube-Stack Configuration.
