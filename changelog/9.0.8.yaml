      summary: reduce-default-telemetry-frequency
      description: Reduce the default telemetry frequency to 60 seconds. This change aims to lower infrastructure costs and reduce label churn in time-series storage. High-cardinality labels sampled too frequently inflate storage and index size, and increase query latency with limited added value. Environments that require higher resolution can change the `collection_interval` for `hostmetrics`, `kubeletstats` and `k8s_cluster` receivers to a lower value.
