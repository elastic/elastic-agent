.Enable Compression By Default For Elasticsearch Outputs. {all-pull}https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/36681[#https://github.com/elastic/beats/pull/36681] {all-issue}https://github.com/elastic/ingest-dev/issues/2458[#https://github.com/elastic/ingest-dev/issues/2458]

====
The default compression level for Elasticsearch outputs is changing from 0 to 1. On typical workloads this is expected to decrease network data volume by 70-80%, while increasing cpu use by 20-25% and ingestion time by 10%. The previous behavior can be restored by adding &#39;compression_level: 0&#39; to the output configuration.
