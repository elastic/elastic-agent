      summary: Support the NETINFO variable in Elastic Kubernetes manifests. Setting a new environmental variable `ELASTIC_NETINFO=false` globally disables the `netinfo.enabled` parameter of the `add_host_metadata` processor. This disables the indexing of `host.ip` and `host.mac` fields.

      summary: Enable compression by default for Elasticsearch outputs
      description: 'The default compression level for Elasticsearch outputs is changing from 0 to 1. On typical workloads this is expected to decrease network data volume by 70-80%, while increasing cpu use by 20-25% and ingestion time by 10%. The previous behavior can be restored by adding ''compression_level: 0'' to the output configuration.'
