      summary: Add agent.internal.runtime.dynamic_inputs flag to control the runtime used by inputs using dynamic variables.
      description: |
        Allow switching to the process runtim for inputs using dynamic variables from a dynamic provider, like the
        Kubernetes provider. These inputs may see frequent configuration reloads, which the otel collector isn't great
        at handling right now.
