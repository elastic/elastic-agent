      summary: Add diagnostics action handler.
      description: |
        Add support for the REQUEST_DIAGNOSTICS action.
        When this action is recieved the agent will collect a diagnostics bundle and
        upload it to fleet-server using the file upload APIs.
        The handler has a configurable rate limit in order to prevent DoS attacks.
        The uploader may retry failures with a configurable exponential backoff.
