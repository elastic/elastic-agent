  The process scraper collects metrics for all available processes of a host without an easy way to limit
  this to only report top N process for example. This results in quite big amount of timeseries.
  Since this is not quite critical for any of the available UIs or dashboards we decide to disable
  it temporarily until we find a better solution. Users that specifically need these metrics
  can also enable it back manually.
