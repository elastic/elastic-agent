# Change summary; a 80ish characters long description of the change.
summary: Fix how multiple Fleet Server hosts are handled

# Long description; in case the summary is not enough to describe the change
# this field accommodate a description without length limits.
description: It fixes the bug when the Elastic Agent would be enrolled using
  a valid Fleet Server URL, but the policy would contain more than one, being
  the first URL unreachable. In that case the Elastic Agent would enroll with
  Fleet Server, but become unhealthy as it'd get stuck trying only the first,
  unreachable Fleet Server host.
