# Change summary; a 80ish characters long description of the change.
summary: Enable compression by default for Elasticsearch outputs

# Long description; in case the summary is not enough to describe the change
# this field accommodate a description without length limits.
# NOTE: This field will be rendered only for breaking-change and known-issue kinds at the moment.
description: "The default compression level for Elasticsearch outputs is changing from 0 to 1. On typical workloads this is expected to decrease network data volume by 70-80%, while increasing cpu use by 20-25% and ingestion time by 10%. The previous behavior can be restored by adding 'compression_level: 0' to the output configuration."
