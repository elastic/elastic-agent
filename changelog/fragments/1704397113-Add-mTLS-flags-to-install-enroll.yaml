  Add mTLS flags to the install/enroll commands to allow fleet-server to
  use client certs when connecting to Elasticsearch, and to allow
  elastic-agent to use client certs when connecting to fleet-server.
  Fleet-server will use the CAs passed in `--certificate-authorities` to
  validate any client certs. Agent client certs do not influence auth in
  fleet-server, an enrollment token, or API key is still required.
