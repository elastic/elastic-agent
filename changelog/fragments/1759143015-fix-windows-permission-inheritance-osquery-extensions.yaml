description: |
  Fixed OSQuery extension loading failures on Windows by disabling permission inheritance on all directories in the agent installation tree. Previously, only the top-level directory had inheritance disabled, which allowed subdirectories to inherit permissions from parent directories. This caused OSQuery's strict security checks to fail, preventing extension loading. The fix ensures that all directories have explicit permissions without inheritance, satisfying OSQuery's security requirements while maintaining proper access for SYSTEM and Administrators. The permission fix is applied during agent startup and installation, addressing both new and existing installations.
