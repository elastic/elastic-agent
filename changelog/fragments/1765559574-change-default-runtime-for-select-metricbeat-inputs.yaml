description: >-
  The following metricbeat inputs will use the otel runtime by
  default if the elasticsearch output is used:

    - "activemq/metrics"
    - "apache/metrics"
    - "beat/metrics"
    - "containerd/metrics"
    - "docker/metrics"
    - "elasticsearch/metrics"
    - "etcd/metrics"
    - "http/metrics"
    - "jolokia/metrics"
    - "kafka/metrics"
    - "kibana/metrics"
    - "linux/metrics"
    - "logstash/metrics"
    - "memcached/metrics"
    - "mongodb/metrics"
    - "mysql/metrics"
    - "nats/metrics"
    - "nginx/metrics"
    - "rabbitmq/metrics"
    - "sql/metrics"
    - "stan/metrics"
    - "statsd/metrics"
    - "system/metrics"
    - "vsphere/metrics"

  This will result in a memory reduction since fewer agentbeat
  processes are started, because the otel runtime runs within the
  collector process.  If the policy is not compatible with the otel
  runtime, it will fall back to the process runtime.
