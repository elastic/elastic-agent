  Add support for --id and --replace-token to the install and enroll command. Add support for ELASTIC_AGENT_ID
  and FLEET_REPLACE_TOKEN to the container support the same behavior as the enroll command. Allows the ability to
  define a specific ID to use for the Elastic Agent when enrolling into Fleet. The replace-token defines the token
  that must be used to re-enroll an Elastic Agent with the same ID as a replacement of the previous Elastic Agent.
