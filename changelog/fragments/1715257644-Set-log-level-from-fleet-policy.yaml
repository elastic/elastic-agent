description: >
  Enables setting agent logging level in policy. Setting a valid
  log level (same values allowed for setting log level on the specific agent)
  in fleet policy under `agent.logging.level` key will cause the agent to
  change its logging level, unless an override is set for the specific
  elastic-agent using a `settings` action.
  
  The order of priority of log level for a fleet managed agent is:
  
  1. log level set specifically to the agent via settings action, if any
  
  2. log level specified in fleet policy, if any
  
  3. default hard-coded log level for elastic-agent
