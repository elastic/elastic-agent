  Alter how elatic-agent passes the fleet-server output component so that the policy's output is used.
  In cases where fleet-server encounters an error when trying to use the policy's output it will use
  the configuration specified during enrollment as a fallback. In cases where it uses the fallback
  the policy's output is periodically retested and used if it's successful.
