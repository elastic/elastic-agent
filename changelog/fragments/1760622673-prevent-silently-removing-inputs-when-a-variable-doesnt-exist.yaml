description: |
    Previously, when a variable didn't exist, the entire input would be silently removed without any error or
    log message. This change fixes that behavior by throwing an error when a variable cannot be substituted
    in an input.

    If you want the input to be silently removed when a variable doesn't exist, append the optional `|?` syntax to
    the end of the variable chain (e.g., `${kubernetes.pod.name|?}`).

# REQUIRED for breaking-change, deprecation, known-issue
impact: |
    Missing or invalid variables will no longer result in the whole input being silently removed. An error will occur
    requiring the policy or configuration to be updated to fix the issue.

# REQUIRED for breaking-change, deprecation, known-issue
action: |
    Add `|?` syntax to the end of the variable change to bring back previous behavior.
