description: |
  Inject a proxy_url value into endpoint's elasticsearch output and endpoint and APM's fleet configuration if there are no existing keys as part of the policy, but the agent default proxy servers are set by enviroment variables.
  The 1st host in the output list is used to determine if the HTTPS_PROXY or HTTP_PROXY value is used, if it can't be determined this way the HTTPS_PROXY is used over HTTP_PROXY.
  Injection will be skipped if the policy sets proxy_disable to true, the proxy_url key is set with an empty value, or the proxy from the env var is empty.
