description: 
    Reduce the default telemetry frequency to 60 seconds.
    This change aims to lower infrastructure costs and reduce label churn in
    time-series storage. High-cardinality labels sampled too frequently inflate
    storage and index size, and increase query latency with limited added
    value.  
    Environments that require higher resolution can change the `collection_interval` for `hostmetrics`, `kubeletstats` and `k8s_cluster` receivers to a lower value.
