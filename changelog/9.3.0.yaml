      summary: Change default runtime for select metricbeat inputs.
      description: |-
        The following metricbeat inputs will use the otel runtime by default if the elasticsearch output is used:

          - "activemq/metrics"
          - "apache/metrics"
          - "beat/metrics"
          - "containerd/metrics"
          - "docker/metrics"
          - "elasticsearch/metrics"
          - "etcd/metrics"
          - "http/metrics"
          - "jolokia/metrics"
          - "kafka/metrics"
          - "kibana/metrics"
          - "linux/metrics"
          - "logstash/metrics"
          - "memcached/metrics"
          - "mongodb/metrics"
          - "mysql/metrics"
          - "nats/metrics"
          - "nginx/metrics"
          - "rabbitmq/metrics"
          - "sql/metrics"
          - "stan/metrics"
          - "statsd/metrics"
          - "system/metrics"
          - "vsphere/metrics"

        This will result in a memory reduction since fewer agentbeat processes are started, because the otel runtime runs within the collector process.  If the policy is not compatible with the otel runtime, it will fall back to the process runtime.
