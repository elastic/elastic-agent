      summary: Reduce memory usage by executing Elastic Agent self-monitoring inputs as OpenTelemetry collector receivers by default.
      description: |
        Self-monitoring inputs which were previously executed as Beat sub-processes are now executed as receivers in a single OpenTelemetry collector sub-process.
        For a Fleet managed Elastic Agent running the default System integration, steady state memory usage is reduced by 11.5% (79.1 MB) on Linux, 34.5% (185.77 MB) on Windows, and 23.0% (115.9 MB) on MacOS.
        This is the first phase of work reducing the Elastic Agent's memory footprint, memory reductions will continue in future releases.
