      summary: On Windows, retry saving the Agent information file to disk
      description: |
        Saving the Agent information file involves renaming/moving a file to its final destination. However, on Windows, it is sometimes not possible to rename/move a file to its destination file because the destination file is locked by another process (e.g. antivirus software). For such situations, we now retry the save operation on Windows.
