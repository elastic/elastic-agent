      description: "Fixing file permission issues for osquery extensions on Windows.\nIt approches the problem by adding List Content permission to Logged in users so Directory permissions are not altered by UAC when traversing Agent directory structure.\nAfter this user won't be prompted with UAC and when opening e.g log files, instead user will run into access denied in editor of choice. \nElevated editor must be used to open files that require elevated permissions.\n"

      summary: Fix elasticsearch retry behavior in OTEL runtime for reliable delivery
      description: Elastic Agent running on the OTEL runtime now retries the same Elasticsearch response codes as standalone Beats, including 5xx errors. Previously, only 429 responses were retried, which could result in dropped events under certain failure conditions.
