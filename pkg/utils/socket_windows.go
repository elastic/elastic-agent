// 1. Windows named pipes must be less than 256 characters.
// 2. Windows named pipes are just a filename not a path.
// The ids can often be longer than 256 characters and contin path separators.  So we follow this
// algorithm to get unique paths that are less than 104
// characters.
// 1. take sha256 of id
// 2. base64 encode the first 24 bytes of hash (full 32 can be too long)
// 3. use URLencoding for base64, this is filename safe and is shorter than hex
