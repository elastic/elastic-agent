// UsableComponent defines a component that the fixture will set up and use.
//
// There is two different ways for defining a usable component.
//  1. Provide a `Name` only.
//     - This will instruct the fixture to keep this component from the fetched Elastic Agent. If the component
//     does not exist in the fetched Elastic Agent then `Prepare` of the fixture will fail.
//  2. Provide a `Name`, `BinaryPath`, and `Spec` or `SpecPath`.
//     - This will instruct the fixture to copy the binary of the component and write the defined specification
//     into the Elastic Agent components directory.
