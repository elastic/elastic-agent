# This script is not only used by integration CI, but also the agentless release pipeline to build the docker images
# that get released to serverless. USE_PACKAGE_VERSION is important here for both CI and agentless, as it validates
# that the components bundled to serverless are the same components that the CI validated.
#
# Making a change here can affect the released images to agentless, so be cautious.
