# Deprecated components registry
#
# Components listed here are marked as deprecated in the EDOT Collector documentation.
# Deprecated components may be removed in future versions.
#
# Format:
#   deprecated:
#     - componentname1
#     - componentname2

deprecated:
  - elasticinframetricsprocessor  # Deprecated in 9.2.0
  # Add deprecated component names here
  # Component names should match exactly as they appear in go.mod (without trailing spaces)
  # Example:
  # - elastictraceprocessor  # Replaced by elasticapmprocessor in 9.2.0
  
  # When a component is deprecated, it will be marked as "Deprecated" in the components table
  # instead of [Core] or [Extended]. The component name will still link to its documentation
  # or source repository, but the status column will clearly show it's deprecated.
  - elastictraceprocessor  # Replaced by elasticapmprocessor in 9.2.0
