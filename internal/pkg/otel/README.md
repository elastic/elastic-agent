# Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector

This is an Elastic supported distribution of the [OpenTelemetry Collector](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector).

## Running the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector

To run the Elastic Distribution for OpenTelemetry Collector you can use Elastic-Agent binary downloaded for your OS and architecture.
Running command

```bash
./elastic-agent otel --config otel.yml
```

from unpacked Elastic Agent package will run Elastic-Agent as an OpenTelemetry Collector. The `--config` flag needs to point to [OpenTelemetry Collector Configuration file](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/). OTel mode is available only using `otel` subcommand. Elastic Agent will not do any autodetection of configuration file passed when used without `otel` subcommand and will try to run normally.

To validate OTel configuration run `otel validate` subcommand:

```bash
./elastic-agent otel validate --config otel.yml
```

[feature gates](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/featuregate/README.md#controlling-gates) are supported using `--feature-gates` flag.
