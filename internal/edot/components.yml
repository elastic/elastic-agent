# Component listed in this file should match the component name as it appears  #
# in the go.mod file dependencies. Specifically, the component name is the     #
# last segment of the dependency path.                                         #
#                                                                              #

      The following features and configuration options are **NOT** officially supported in the EDOT Collector with the Kafka receiver:
      - Encoding options other than `otlp_proto` or `otlp_json`
      - Using the Sarama client (i.e. opting out of the `exporter.kafkaexporter.UseFranzGo` feature gate is not supported)
